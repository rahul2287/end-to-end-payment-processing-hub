# End-to-End Payment Processing Hub

## Overview

**End-to-End Payment Processing Hub** is a modular, scalable, and secure platform designed for the **banking and financial services industry**. This hub orchestrates the complete lifecycle of a payment—from initiation to settlement—across various channels and clearing networks such as **RTP, ACH, Fedwire, and SWIFT**.

Built using **Spring Boot**, this enterprise-grade engine supports **real-time validations**, **compliance checks**, **fraud detection**, **sanctions screening**, **posting**, and **clearing integration** with both internal and external systems.

- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Rules**
- **KYC & Identity Verification**

###  Fraud Detection
